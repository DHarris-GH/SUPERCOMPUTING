In this day and age, the ability to remotely access machines has been utilized in the workforce and in higher education as well. 
I have had little experience with supercomputing in some computer science courses, but it was quickly glossed over. 
As a result, I feel underprepared in this subject as a senior who is about to enter the job field soon. 
When I saw that this course was offered, I thought it was the perfect opportunity to learn crucial skills that I will continue to utilize outside of university. 

I only have a few goals for this course, with the first being to familiarize myself with GitHub. 
GitHub is commonly used by many to share code, so it would be beneficial to learn how to use it. 
Next, I aim to use terminal commands efficiently. 
There were times when I had to write code from the terminal, and without any prior knowledge, it was quite difficult. 
Memorizing useful commands is definitely in my best interest. 
Finally, I need to understand how supercomputing works so I can properly utilize any HPC.

There are several ways to plan for success in this course. 
First, I will complete the readings preferably before or directly after lectures. 
This way, I can ensure I properly understand and use any techniques shown by the professor. 
Although it is difficult for me at times, asking questions during class is crucial for clearing up any confusion that can lead to mistakes later. 
Additionally, using resources outside the textbook is great for topics I may not immediately understand. Lastly, I need to complete assignments on time. 
The more time wasted is more time to forget what I’ve learned if it’s not utilized.

The folder structure created in class is best for reproducible research because it is easy to navigate through. 
If files are stored carelessly in folders, others who want to reproduce this research will be unsure where to start. 
Data and code need to be properly labeled and separated clearly for later use. 
All file names need to be concise but still very informative to get the point across to those who haven’t seen it before. 
Using these techniques will guarantee that anyone will be able to properly recreate any research project.

It is crucial to use documented code to do computational tasks because not only is it necessary for computers to run code, but it is also the main reason why research can be retraced. 
With documented code, anyone can follow the exact steps that were taken during the process to get the expected results. 
This prevents commands from being written incorrectly later on by someone attempting to replicate for the first time. 
Documentation is crucial for readability and efficiency, especially with complex processing pipelines.

Despite not having much experience in this subject, I’m very determined to try my best in this course. 
I can be considered a slow learner at times, but I’ll eventually understand the concepts with time and a great amount of practice.
