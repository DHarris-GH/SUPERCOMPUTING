cd ./PATH/TO/YOUR/DIRECTORY/SUPERCOMPUTING
mkdir assignments
ls
cd assignments
mkdir assignment_1
cd assignment_1
touch assignment_1_essay.md
ls
touch README.md
ls

NOTE:
ls was used as a substitution to the tree command because it was not installed yet.
However, I still wanted to confirm that the files/directory was created.
These commands still achieve the desire results.
